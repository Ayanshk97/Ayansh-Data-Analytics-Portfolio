# Ayansh-Data-Analytics-Portfolio
🛳 Titanic Data Cleaning & EDA Project
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the famous Titanic dataset.
The goal is to handle missing values, remove duplicates, correct data types, and generate summary statistics for further analysis or modeling.

📂 Project Files

Titanic_Data_Cleaning_Project.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook with all cleaning steps

Titanic_Cleaned.csv → Final cleaned dataset

README.md → Project documentation

⚙️ Tools & Libraries

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Dataset: Titanic CSV

🔍 Steps Performed

Data Exploration → Checked structure, data types, and summary statistics.

Missing Values →

Filled Age with median

Filled Embarked with mode

Dropped Cabin (too many missing values)

Duplicates → Removed duplicate records.

Summary Statistics → Generated descriptive stats for numerical & categorical data.

Output → Clean dataset (Titanic_Cleaned.csv) ready for visualization or modeling.

📊 Sample Insights

Median passenger age ≈ 28 years

Majority of passengers embarked from Southampton (S)

Around 19% missing ages were successfully imputed

Over 800 unique passenger records remain after cleaning
